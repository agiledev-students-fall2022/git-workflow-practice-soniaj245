### Why I Find It Interesting

I found this article incredibly interesting for a few particular reasons. First and foremost, as a soon-to-be graduate and working software engineer, I am particularly interested in reading about the current issues in workplace development operations. The article addresses burnout as a serious problem within the industry and looks for ways to solve it. With an understanding of the problems that arise within a workplace setting, I hope to help potentially provide solutions for myself and other software engineers in promoting a balanced work-life and developing a more positive work environment in highly stress-inducing jobs. Secondly, I ran across this article accidentally and found it to be perfectly fitting for the discussions we have in this course. The reading states, "The most significant factors contributing to those feelings of burnout include high workload, inefficient processes and poorly-defined project goals and targets." Afterward, it identifies agile methodologies as "tried-and-true...that fail if only the symptoms of our infrastructure issues are addressed." Therefore, I think this article is a great additional resource for promoting proper developmental operations in a work environment when faced with problems outside of an agile methodology.

Lastly, this article provides excellent suggestions for how someone in a managerial position can work to improve issues a workplace might face. It focuses on newer technology that some companies may choose not to use, which can help improve work efficiency and help software engineers maintain interest in their tasks, even when they can be mundane. One suggestion that I find intriguing is intelligent automation to help develop low-level tasks. While I understand the humanistic approach to developing software, even at the most basic levels, this solution targets a vital issue, according to the article, of the imbalanced supply and demand present in today's programming sphere.

## Comments

I like the fact the article comments on possible solutions to address the devops burnout rather than identifying the problem. I often feel the benefits companies offer in terms of free food and company merch are poor attempts to distract from the burn-out employees face. It's best when this burnout is managed as quality work will be produced in turn.

I too find this article to be interesting because I am also a soon-to-be graduate and I just came off of muy internship at Collins Aerospace. Even though I am only 21 years old, and it was my second internship, I knew right away that the type of work that was assigned to me over the course of the summmer was not something I saw myself doing for an extended period of time. Although, the reasons for this feeling align with some of the explanations in the article. I had a high workload, with little knowledge and direction of what I was actually supposed to be doing. This led me to have poorly-defined project goals, because I lacked enough knowledge to even make a goal for myself. I agree with Sonia, on the fact that the demand and importance of advancing software and its' development are extremely important. Although in order to make sure we are getting the best work our of our engineers and developers, we've got to make sure they're happy!
