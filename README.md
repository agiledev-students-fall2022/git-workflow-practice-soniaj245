### Why I Find It Interesting

I found this article incredibly interesting for a few particular reasons. First and foremost, as a soon-to-be graduate and working software engineer, I am particularly interested in reading about the current issues in workplace development operations. The article addresses burnout as a serious problem within the industry and looks for ways to solve it. With an understanding of the problems that arise within a workplace setting, I hope to help potentially provide solutions for myself and other software engineers in promoting a balanced work-life and developing a more positive work environment in highly stress-inducing jobs. Secondly, I ran across this article accidentally and found it to be perfectly fitting for the discussions we have in this course. The reading states, "The most significant factors contributing to those feelings of burnout include high workload, inefficient processes and poorly-defined project goals and targets." Afterward, it identifies agile methodologies as "tried-and-true...that fail if only the symptoms of our infrastructure issues are addressed." Therefore, I think this article is a great additional resource for promoting proper developmental operations in a work environment when faced with problems outside of an agile methodology.

Lastly, this article provides excellent suggestions for how someone in a managerial position can work to improve issues a workplace might face. It focuses on newer technology that some companies may choose not to use, which can help improve work efficiency and help software engineers maintain interest in their tasks, even when they can be mundane. One suggestion that I find intriguing is intelligent automation to help develop low-level tasks. While I understand the humanistic approach to developing software, even at the most basic levels, this solution targets a vital issue, according to the article, of the imbalanced supply and demand present in today's programming sphere.
